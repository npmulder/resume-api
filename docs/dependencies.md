# Dependencies Documentation

## Core Dependencies

### HTTP Framework
- **[Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)** `v1.10.1`
  - Fast HTTP web framework with a martini-like API
  - Chosen for: Performance, middleware support, JSON binding, validation
  - Usage: HTTP routing, middleware, request/response handling

### Database
- **[pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)** `v5.7.5`
  - PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go
  - Chosen for: Performance, PostgreSQL-specific features, connection pooling
  - Usage: Database connections, queries, transactions
  - Note: Using v5 for the latest features and performance improvements

### Configuration
- **[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)** `v1.20.1`
  - Complete configuration solution for Go applications
  - Chosen for: Environment variables, config files, defaults, validation
  - Usage: Loading configuration from multiple sources (.env, YAML, flags)

### Testing
- **[Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)** `v1.10.0`
  - Testing toolkit with assertions, mocks, and suites
  - Chosen for: Clean test syntax, mocking capabilities, test organization
  - Usage: Unit tests, integration tests, mocking interfaces

### Logging
- **slog** (Go standard library)
  - Built-in structured logging package (Go 1.21+)
  - Chosen for: No external dependencies, structured logging, performance
  - Usage: Application logging with structured output

## Development Dependencies

### Database Migrations
- **[golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)** `v4.18.3`
  - Database migration tool
  - Usage: Database schema versioning and migrations
  - Note: Also includes CLI tool for migration management

- **[lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq)** `v1.10.9`
  - PostgreSQL driver for golang-migrate
  - Usage: Migration tool database connectivity

## Dependency Choices Rationale

### HTTP Framework: Gin vs Alternatives
- **Gin**: Chosen for performance and ecosystem
- **Echo**: Similar performance, smaller community
- **Chi**: Minimal but less features
- **Fiber**: Fast but different paradigm

### Database Driver: pgx vs Alternatives
- **pgx**: Chosen for PostgreSQL-specific optimizations
- **database/sql + pq**: More generic but less performant
- **GORM**: ORM overhead not needed for this project

### Configuration: Viper vs Alternatives
- **Viper**: Chosen for flexibility and feature completeness
- **envconfig**: Simpler but less flexible
- **cobra + viper**: Overkill for API-only application

### Testing: Testify vs Alternatives
- **Testify**: Chosen for comprehensive testing toolkit
- **Standard testing**: Basic but requires more boilerplate
- **Ginkgo**: BDD-style but unnecessary complexity

## Version Management

### Direct Dependencies
These are the main libraries our code imports:
```
github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.10.1
github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4 v4.18.3
github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.7.5
github.com/lib/pq v1.10.9
github.com/spf13/viper v1.20.1
github.com/stretchr/testify v1.10.0
```

### Indirect Dependencies
These are automatically managed transitive dependencies that our direct dependencies require.

## Security Considerations

- All dependencies are from well-maintained, popular repositories
- Regular security updates through `go get -u` and `go mod tidy`
- Pin major versions to avoid breaking changes
- Monitor for security advisories via GitHub Dependabot

## Performance Impact

- **Gin**: Minimal overhead, optimized routing
- **pgx**: High-performance PostgreSQL driver
- **Viper**: Configuration loaded once at startup
- **slog**: Zero-allocation structured logging
- **Testify**: Development-only, no runtime impact

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additions
- **CORS middleware**: `github.com/gin-contrib/cors`
- **Rate limiting**: `github.com/gin-contrib/limiter`
- **Metrics**: `github.com/prometheus/client_golang`
- **Validation**: Enhanced validation beyond Gin's built-in

### Upgrade Strategy
- Monitor for security updates monthly
- Test major version upgrades in development
- Use `go list -u -m all` to check for available updates
- Pin to specific versions for production stability
